# Overview

Welcome to the RLBot wiki!
RLBot is a framework for creating offline Rocket League bots.
The framework uses an official Psyonix API making our bots safe to play with and against.
This wiki primarily houses resources for bot development, but you can also find guides for users, framework documentation, and community insights.
