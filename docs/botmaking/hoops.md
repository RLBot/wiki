The RLBot framework support the Hoops game mode. This page contains useful values specifically about Hoops.

To make RLBot start a Hoops game you have to set the following values in `rlbot.cfg`:

```
game_mode = Hoops
# Alternative map: Hoops_TheBlocks
game_map = Hoops_DunkHouse
```

## Arena

![](/img/hoops/hoops-dimensions.png)

Hoops is usually played on the map Dunk House or The Block. The dimensions for the arena are:

- Floor z: 0
- Side wall x: ±2966.67
- Back wall y: ±3581
- Ceiling z: 1820
- The diagonal walls intersect the x and y axes at: ±5782
- Wall bottom ramp radius: 172

### Goals

In Hoops, the goals are two rings. The rings are semi-circles placed (0, ±2969, 364) with radius 655 and they are connected to the wall with straight lines (except a small curve near the walls). The pipe that makes up the ring has a diameter of approximately 42.


### Boost Pads

There are 20 boost pads on a Hoops arena, 6 of them are big.

Big boost pads are located at (±2176, ±2944, 8) and (±2432, 0, 8).

Locations of all boost pads:

```

## Ball

The radius of the ball is 98.38. When the kickout countdown hits zero, the ball is given a Z velocity of 1000. But other than that, the physics of the ball is similar to soccer.
