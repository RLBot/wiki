# Bot Loadouts and Logos

## Logos

You can give your bot/script a logo, which will be displayed in the RLBotGUI and sometimes tournaments.
The logo must be a 400x300 pixels png file.
You specify the logo using `logo_file` under the `[settings]` header in the config toml file. See [Config Files](../config-files).

## Customizing Loadouts in the GUI

The easiest way to customize your bot's loadout is via the RLBotGUI. To bring up the loadout editor, click on the bot info icon and then click Edit Loadout.

You can use any item in the game, including painted items. The editor should have the latest items, but we have to manually update them. So if some recently added items are missing, please remind us on our Discord server.
You can also click the bottom left buttons to preview your loadout in-game instantly!

**Tip:** When previewing in-game and trying multiple loadouts, sometimes the camera will lose track of your car when it respawns. You can avoid this by cycling the camera with your mouse buttons *instead* of using the number keys. With this technique it should be possible to get into a camera mode like hard-attach and have it be stable as you look at different wheels, blue car vs orange car, etc.

## Manual Loadout Customization

In your bot's config file you can set your bot's loadout file with the `loadout_file` field under the `[settings]` header.

??? example "Loadout toml file example"

    A loadout toml file looks like this:

    ```
    [blue_loadout]
    team_color_id = 29
    custom_color_id = 0
    car_id = 23
    decal_id = 6083
    wheels_id = 1580
    boost_id = 35
    antenna_id = 0
    hat_id = 0
    paint_finish_id = 0
    custom_finish_id = 0
    engine_audio_id = 6919
    trails_id = 3220
    goal_explosion_id = 4118

    [orange_loadout]
    team_color_id = 69
    custom_color_id = 0
    car_id = 23
    decal_id = 6083
    wheels_id = 1580
    boost_id = 35
    antenna_id = 0
    hat_id = 0
    paint_finish_id = 1681
    custom_finish_id = 1681
    engine_audio_id = 5635
    trails_id = 3220
    goal_explosion_id = 4118

    [blue_loadout.paint]
    car_paint_id = 12
    decal_paint_id = 12
    wheels_paint_id = 12
    boost_paint_id = 12
    antenna_paint_id = 0
    hat_paint_id = 0
    trails_paint_id = 12
    goal_explosion_paint_id = 12

    [orange_loadout.paint]
    car_paint_id = 12
    decal_paint_id = 12
    wheels_paint_id = 12
    boost_paint_id = 12
    antenna_paint_id = 0
    hat_paint_id = 0
    trails_paint_id = 12
    goal_explosion_paint_id = 12
    ```

### Item IDs

The GUI loadout editor uses a CSV file generated by BakkesMod using the `dumpitems` command. You can see the most recently generated file [here](https://github.com/RLBot/gui/blob/master/frontend/src/assets/items.csv).

To see the items, you might want to browse https://rocket-league.com/items/ or just use the editor in the GUI instead.

### Colors

Use `team_color_id` and `custom_color_id` to index into the swatches (see images below).

`team_color_id` are the primary color of the car. The top left color is index 0 increasing as you go right:

![](/img/bot-customization/blue-team.png)

![](/img/bot-customization/orange-team.png)

`custom_color_id` is the secondary color, also called accent. These are identical for both teams:

![](/img/bot-customization/secondary-color.png)

!!! warning
    The shade of the colors may not be correspond exactly with pictures.

### Painted Items

For painted items, use the paint index below:

- 0 - None
- 1 - Crimson
- 2 - Lime
- 3 - Black
- 4 - Sky Blue
- 5 - Cobalt
- 6 - Burnt Sienna
- 7 - Forest Green
- 8 - Purple
- 9 - Pink
- 10 - Orange
- 11 - Grey
- 12 - Titanium White
- 13 - Saffron

These are set in your loadout toml file under the `[blue_loadout.paint]` and `[orange_loadout.paint]` headers. See the example in the section above.

## Generating a Loadout

Your bot does not have to look the same every match.
During initialization of a bot, you can set your bot's loadout to any loadout, typically using a `set_loadout(...)` method.
This enables you to choose different loadouts based on player index or game mode or randomize parts of your loadout, etc. Be fancy!

!!! warning
    We recommend having a default loadout specified by a `loadout.toml`. Your bot will use this as a fallback in matches where cars are spawned immediately, e.g. if `wait_for_agents=false` or `existing_match_behavior="ContinueAndSpawn"` in the match configuration.
