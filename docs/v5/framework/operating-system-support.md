## Windows

RLBot can launch Rocket League through Steam or Epic Game Store.

## Linux

RLBot currently supports either Rocket League running under Proton on Steam or
Rocket League installed from the Epic Games Store via [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) and [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/).

## Mac

Native MacOS support has been dropped. It's recommended to run both Rocket League
and RLBot under a virtual machine running Windows or Linux.
