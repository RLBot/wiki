# RLBot Pack

The RLBotPack is a repository holding frequently requested bots in one convenient place. The main intended users are people joining the discord looking for a fun bot to try out. It may also be useful as a way for people running streams to get an up-to-date version of your bot.

The details for the v5 botpack are still a WIP. However, there are somethings we know for sure:

- All bots and scripts will be required to compile into a single executable file
- Source code will be submitted to a central repository where a trusted, automated system will build and publish it
