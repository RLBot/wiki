The current phase is the variable <code>damage_index</code> where:</p> <ul> <li>0: Normal</li> <li>1: Charged</li> <li>2: Super Charged</li> </ul> <p>The ball gains charge as it is hit by cars. When a car exerts a force on the ball, the ball charges up equal to the magnitude of the force (energy). The ball enters the next phase when it reaches a certain threshold:</p> <ul> <li>Charged: 2500 energy</li> <li>Super Charged: 11000 energy</li> </ul> <p>The current amount of energy (force absorded) is the <code>absorbed_force</code> variable.</p> <p>However, a hit does not always charge the ball. To make the ball charge up, the impact must be at least 500 energy, otherwise the ball will not charge at all. Furthermore, when the ball gets hit, it will temporarily accept less energy. The variable <code>force_accum_recent</code> stores the accumulated absorbed force (energy), but no more than 2500 energy. It decays over time at a rate of 2500 energy per second, and the ball will at most absorb <code>2500 - force_accum_recent</code> energy on a hit. Combined, this prevents players from charging the ball too quickly, limited to 2500 energy every second.</p> <p>Example: if you hit the ball with an impact of 2000 uu/s at t=0, and you hit the ball again with a force of 2000 uu/s at t=0.5, the <code>force_accum_recent</code> has decayed by 1250 and will be 750 when you hit the ball the second time, and therefore the ball will not accept more than 1750 energy, which means 250 energy gets lost.</p> <p>The ball's charge is reset, whenever it damages a floor tile owned by the opponent of whoever last touched the ball. To make damage the ball must hit the tile with a velocity of 250 uu/s or more perpendicular to the surface of contact. The side of a tile can only be hit if there's an open tile next to it, so usually the ball will hit the top of the tiles, and in those cases only the Z velocity matters, and must be 250 uu/s or more to make damage.

Once you feel confident, join the RLGym discord, check out the official RLGym website which has useful docs and guides, and look at the dedicated #machine-learning channel in the RLBot discord for helpful resources.</p> <p>Q: What can I use ML for in Rocket League?</p> <p>A: Lots of things! Most people simply use it to make bots for playing the game, but that isn't all. Optimizing specific mechanics rather than the entire game (wave-dashing, aerials, power-sliding, etc) and analyzing replays (predicting shot percentages, car positions, etc) are some other things people have done.</p> <p>Q: How could I use the replays available at calculated.gg?</p> <p>A: Tools like Training Data Extractor and carball exist to format replay data into an RLBot tick packet, and approximate player inputs between frames. These enable users to easily handle data available in replays for whatever purpose they might have.</p> <p>Q: Is it possible to get controls from replays so I can train a model to copy humans?:</p> <p>A: Training controls directly from replays has been used to some success, most notably with Ripple. There exist tools to find inputs from replay files, such as RLCarInputSolver, and even public replay repositories (such as the one Ripple used, here) with tens of thousands of hours of data!</p> <p>Q: Can I use a clone of Rocket League for training and then transfer it to the real game?</p> <p>A: This is how most people train now! Rocketsim is used for training by basically everyone, but you don't really have to think about it, as rocketsim is used by default by current libraries.</p> <p>Q: Can I use Supervised Learning to train a bot that mimics other bots?</p> <p>A: Yes you can! The ML bots Levi and Tensorbot were trained this way.</p> <p>Q: Can I use this or that method to speed up Reinforcement Learning?</p> <p>A: Try it out!

When a car exerts a force on the ball, the ball charges up equal to the magnitude of the force (energy). The ball enters the next stage when it reaches a certain threshold:</p> <ul> <li>Charged: 2500 energy</li> <li>Super Charged: 11000 energy</li> </ul> <p>However, a hit does not always charge the ball. To make the ball charge up, the impact must be at least 500 energy, otherwise the ball will not charge at all. Furthermore, when the ball gets hit, it will temporarily accept less energy. The variable <code>force_accum_recent</code> stores the accumulated absorbed force (energy), but no more than 2500 energy. It decays over time at a rate of 2500 energy per second, and the ball will at most absorb <code>2500 - force_accum_recent</code> energy on a hit. Combined, this prevents players from charging the ball too quickly, limited to 2500 energy every second.</p> Ball Charging Example <p>If you hit the ball with an impact of 2000 uu/s at t=0, then the balls energy as well as <code>force_accum_recent</code> becomes 2000.

If you at t=0.5 hit the ball again with a force of 2000 uu/s, the ball will not accept more than 1750 energy (2500 - <code>force_accum_recent</code>), which means 250 energy gets lost.</p> <p>The ball's charge is reset, whenever it damages a floor tile owned by the opponent of whoever last touched the ball. To make damage the ball must hit the tile with a velocity of 250 uu/s or more perpendicular to the surface of contact. The side of a tile can only be hit if there's an open tile next to it, so usually the ball will hit the top of the tiles, and in those cases only the Z velocity matters, and must be 250 uu/s or more to make damage. There is also must have passed 0.2 seconds since the last time the ball damaged a tile.</p> <p>At kickoff the ball is launched straight up into the air with a velocity of 1000 uu/s and reaches a height of about 847 uu in 1.54 seconds.</p>"},{"location":"v5/botmaking/dropshot/#spawning","title":"Spawning","text":"<p>You always spawn with 100 boost.</p> <p>Kickoff spawn locations are similar to soccar spawn locations, but not identical.

Once you feel confident, join the RLGym discord, check out the official RLGym website which has useful docs and guides, and look at the dedicated #machine-learning channel in the RLBot discord for helpful resources.</p> <p>Q: What can I use ML for in Rocket League?</p> <p>A: Lots of things! Most people simply use it to make bots for playing the game, but that isn't all. Optimizing specific mechanics rather than the entire game (wave-dashing, aerials, power-sliding, etc) and analyzing replays (predicting shot percentages, car positions, etc) are some other things people have done.</p> <p>Q: How could I use the replays available at calculated.gg?</p> <p>A: Tools like Training Data Extractor and carball exist to format replay data into an RLBot tick packet, and approximate player inputs between frames. These enable users to easily handle data available in replays for whatever purpose they might have.</p> <p>Q: Is it possible to get controls from replays so I can train a model to copy humans?:</p> <p>A: Training controls directly from replays has been used to some success, most notably with Ripple. There exist tools to find inputs from replay files, such as RLCarInputSolver, and even public replay repositories (such as the one Ripple used, here) with tens of thousands of hours of data!</p> <p>Q: Can I use a clone of Rocket League for training and then transfer it to the real game?</p> <p>A: This is how most people train now!

Once the RLBotServer receives a MatchConfiguration, it will start up Rocket League with the <code>-rlbot</code> flag (if needed) and then the bot and script processes. RLBotServer communicates with Rocket League through the official Psyonix API. Since the API is under NDA, a closed-source Bridge.dll hide the details of the API. On startup bots and scripts connect to the RLBotServer and are briefed about the match, their index, and more. Once the match is loaded, RLBotServer will send live game data to all connected clients, and optionally ball prediction and match comms. Each bot client control their car(s) by responding to each GamePacket with PlayerInput.

This port can be changed by launching RLBot and specifying a different port for the first argument. For example, to have RLBot listen on port <code>12345</code> instead, you would run <code>RLBotServer.exe 12345</code>.</p> <p>This means that external processes can connect to RLBot from other machines on the same network by specifying the IP address of the machine running RLBot and the port number RLBot is listening on.

It was made in 2018 when RLBot was still using DLL injection. Later, in 2019, the collaboration with Psyonix and the official API was introduced. Since then, there have only been minor changes and new features, which prove how well-designed v4 was. In fact, v5 is not that different from v4. It is primarily a rewrite and an opportunity to fix the flaws of v4 that have been revealed over the years. So here are the main reasons we made v5:</p> <ul> <li>The closed-source part of v4 is doing more than just communication with the Psyonix API.   This has long prevented the community from fixing certain bugs themselves.   Therefore, we are extracting that functionality into the open-source part of RLBot, making the closed-source part exclusively about communication with the API.</li> <li>The closed-source part of v4 is written in C++.   By rewriting the backend of RLBot in C#, we hope that more people feel comfortable contributing to it.</li> <li>No more DLLs. You may not be aware, but most bots still use a DLL to communicate directly to the RLBot backend.   In v5, the transition to web sockets is finally complete and this allows the bot interfaces to be improved (e.g. Python type hints are not a hack anymore).</li> <li>All languages can start matches in v4, but the logic for launching Rocket League and bots was only implemented in Python (and partially Rust).   This discouraged people from writing match starters (GUI, autoleague, etc) in languages other than Python (even CleoPetra, written in Java, uses a Python process to start matches).   Therefore, we are moving this logic to the backend for v5, such that more languages can benefit from it.</li> <li>We are freeing ourselves from design choices made under the restrictions of the DLL injection.</li> <li>The Psyonix API made a few extra features available to us, but we never integrated them in v4. They are integrated in v5.</li> <li>Python is very slow. The rewrite in C# has made this clear.</li> <li>The <code>.cfg</code> file format has no standard. We are changing to the similar <code>.toml</code> format.</li> </ul> <p>So while the changes to the functionality and interface are minor, the architecture and the framework's internal code is very different.
